This is the crystal workbook for my Ruby on Ales 2016 talk.

With a version of crystal >= 0.15.0, go to the root of this project and run
`crystal play`, then go to `localhost:8080/workbook` in your browser.

If you're curious about the construction jokes, the theme for the second day
of the conference was constructionneering.

The video of the talk will be at http://confreaks.tv/events/roa2016
